## 📌 About This Project

This project was originally inspired by a web development course on LinkedIn and a project from Web Dev Simplified. I used it as a learning opportunity to implement my own ideas including:
- Custom plant & flower replacements
- Theme redesign
- Background music integration
- Mute/unmute functionality
